    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Make some instant ramen. Slide an egg into the hot broth, then some butter. Crown the steaming noodles with slices of American cheese. Scatter a bunch of toasted sesame seeds and chopped scallions across the top, if you want to. Hardly a recipe! But for the chef Roy Choi, who gave it to The Times in 2014, doctored instant ramen is a taste of Korean-American straight-from-the-bag soul food. The butter, egg and cheese help coat the ramen noodles and deepen their flavor.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pack ramen noodles with flavor packet</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon butter</li>
      <li>2 slices American cheese</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
      <li>½ scallion, green part only, thinly sliced on the bias, optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring 2½ cups of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Add the noodles and cook for 2 minutes. Add the flavor packet, stir, and continue to cook for another 30 seconds.</li>
      <li>Remove the pan from the heat and carefully add the egg. Do not stir; pull the noodles over the egg and let sit for one minute to poach.</li>
      <li>Carefully transfer everything to a serving bowl, add the butter, cheese and sesame seeds and mix. Garnish with the scallions if desired.</li>
    </ol>
